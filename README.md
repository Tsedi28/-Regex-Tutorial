# -Regex-Tutorial
This Regex (Regular Expression) tutorial is created to help you understand and define the sequence of special characters to verify a search term. A Regex is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also used frequently to validate input data.

Summary
The following code will be used throughout the tutorial to give specific examples for how the components of regex can be used. The following code can be used for matching emails. One use for this code is that it can be used to validate to make sure that an email follows the correct format.

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The anchor is what starts and ends the regular expression. 
In the matching email code, 

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`, 

the anchors are the `^` and the `$`. This code specifically is saying that we are looking for something that starts with 

`^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` 

we will define what everything inside the parentheses later in this tutorial, but what the anchor means is that if we are to find a match it has follow those initial guidelines. It also has to end with 

`.([a-z\.]{2,6})$`.

So, it must start and end with the given parameters within the code. If it does not, then it is not a match.
